<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project has a dynamic input that accepts only letters and numbers, with a minimum length of 3. This dynamic input validates the string typed into it and provide immediate, inline feedback to the end-user. It shows five states Default, Focus, Valid, Invalid and Limbo. Limbo represents the time between a string being typed into the input and its validated state of either Valid or Invalid. The Default and Focus states are simply states that exist before any focus is provided or text typed and validated.

### Libraries used
